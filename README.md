## üîç Tasks Overview

### **Task 1: Iris Dataset Exploration**
- **Objective:** Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset to understand class separability.
- **Dataset:** [UCI Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris)
- **Models:** None (EDA only)
- **Key Findings:**
  - Petal features show clear separation between species.
  - Dataset is clean and well-suited for classification tasks.

### **Task 2: Stock Price Prediction**
- **Objective:** Predict Apple Inc. (AAPL) next-day closing price using historical data.
- **Dataset:** yFinance API (Jan 2020 ‚Äì Jan 2024)
- **Model Used:** Linear Regression
- **Results:**
  - **MSE:** 4.9761
  - **Insight:** Model performs reasonably well for trend prediction. Future work can include LSTM or ARIMA for improved performance.
